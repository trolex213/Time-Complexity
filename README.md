# Time-Complexity
In this assignment, I implemented a number of methods for a class Complexity. These
methods are implemented using for loops. In addition, each of these methods will print out the value of an accumulator that
counts the number of “operations” performed. 

In other words, the idea is that if you are requested to implement a method of time complexity O(n),
then it should print out values from 1 to n (or close enough).

The methods I implemented are as follows: 
1. public static void method1(int n): a method that has time complexity O(n^2).
2  public static void method2(int n): a method that has time complexity O(n^3).
3. public static void method3(int n): a method that has time complexity O(log n).
4. public static void method4(int n): a method that has time complexity O(nlog n).
5. public static void method5(int n): a method that has time complexity O(log(log n)).
6. public static int method6(int n): a method that has time complexity O(2^n) using recursion.

I was also given the following code:

and I was aksed to fill in a table(using Java comments) below the code with the values that _end_ and _start_ take in every iteration before the while loop exits.
